Hover Effect is easily applied to your own elements, modified or just used for inspiration.

== Description ==
All effects make use of a single element (with the help of some pseudo-elements where necessary), are self contained so you can easily copy and paste them.

Many effects use CSS3 features such as transitions, transforms and animations. Old browsers that don't support these features may need some extra attention to be certain a fallback hover effect is still in place.
